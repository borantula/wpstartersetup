### ChangeLog for GitHub Updater

#### 2.1.x

 * moved check and load for `markdown.php` into only function that uses it.

#### 2.1.1

 * bug fix to return early from call to `plugins_api` if not getting plugin information. Fixes issue with Plugin Search.

#### 2.1.0

 * simplify check for `class Markdown_Parser`
 * refactor to pass `class GitHub_Update_GitHub_API` as class object. This should enable the creation of other class objects for Bitbucket, etc.
 * fix for setting branch when API not responding
 * fix for setting download link when API not responding
 * redesigned filter for setting transient timeout, but still not working (pull requests welcome)

#### 2.0.1

 * bug fix to not load `markdown.php` twice. Just in case it's loaded by some other plugin.

#### 2.0.0

 * rearranged where I put `GitHub Plugin URI` header, etc. in README and in this plugin.
 * minor spelling fixes
 * renamed some functions for their hooks
 * refactored `class GitHub_Plugin_Updater` and `class GitHub_Theme_Updater` to use stdClass objects 
 * further refactored base class `GitHub_Updater` to contain renaming code and create stdClass objects for data.
 * added some ability to see changelog for GitHub hosted plugins.
 * trying to follow <a href="https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate">WordPress Plugin Boilerplate</a>, so renamed `classes` to `includes`
 * refactored putting all remote api calls in new `class GitHub_Plugin_Updater_API`.
 * Theme updating should now be able to have a specified branch.
 * works on WordPress 3.8
 * included Michel Fortin's [PHP-Markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/) for rendering `CHANGES.md` 

#### 1.8.1

 * added some variable declarations
 * added early return in no GitHub sourced plugins or themes are identified

#### 1.8.0

 * refactored to use base class `GitHub_Updater` and extending classes `GitHub_Plugin_Updater` and `GitHub_Theme_Updater`.

#### 1.7.4

 * changed method of not overwriting extra headers to pass array.

#### 1.7.3

 * change `'...'` to `&#8230` in renaming notification
 * fix to not overwrite extra headers of other plugins.

#### 1.7.2

 * removed sorting option from `scandir`. Doesn't work with older versions of PHP < 5.4.0
 * removed extraneous data from array in `multisite_get_themes`

#### 1.7.1

 * updated the transient for themes
 * replaced `readdir` with `scandir` for creating WP\_Theme object in multisite

#### 1.7.0

 * updated class-theme-updater.php to utilize WP\_Theme class
 * added method `get_remote_tag` to update plugins using tags or branch, depending upon which has greater version number.
 * `get_remote_tag` uses transient to limit calls to API
 * fix for `wp_get_themes` not working under plugin network activation on multisite installation. I recreated `wp_get_themes` by reading in the theme directory and adding the WP\_Theme object of `wp_get_theme( 'dir_in_themes_dir' )` to an array.
