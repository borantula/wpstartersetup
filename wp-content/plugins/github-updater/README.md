# GitHub Updater

A simple plugin to enable automatic updates to your GitHub hosted WordPress plugins and themes.

This plugin is not allowed in the wp.org repo. :frowning:

## Description

This plugin was designed to simply update any GitHub hosted WordPress plugin or theme. Your plugin or theme **must** contain a header in the style.css header or in the plugin's header denoting the location on GitHub. The format is as follows.

`GitHub Theme URI: afragen/test-child`  
`GitHub Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/test-child`

or 

`GitHub Plugin URI: afragen/github-updater`  
`GitHub Plugin URI: https://github.com/afragen/github-Updater`

...where the above URI leads to the __owner/repository__ of your theme or plugin. The URI may be in the format `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` or the short format `<owner>/<repo>`.

## Requirements
 * WordPress 3.4 (tested up to 3.8)

## Installation

1. Download the latest tagged archive (choose the "zip" option).
2. Go to the __Plugins -> Add New__ screen and click the __Upload__ tab.

`git clone git@github.com:afragen/github-updater.git`

Then go to your Plugins screen and click __Activate__.

## Usage

### Themes

There must be a `GitHub Theme URI` declaration in the `style.css` file and you **must** create a tag in GitHub for each version.

~~~css
/*
Theme Name:       Test
Theme URI:        http://drfragen.info/
Version:          0.1.0
Description:      Child theme of TwentyTwelve.
Author:           Andy Fragen
Template:         twentytwelve
Template Version: 1.0.0
GitHub Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/test-child
GitHub Branch:    master
*/
~~~

### Plugins 
In your plugin the following is an example. You do not need to create a tag in GitHub for your plugin version, but if you do create tags, the plugin will use `version_compare` to determine if your tag is greater than the version in your branch.

~~~php
/*
Plugin Name:       GitHub Updater
Plugin URI:        https://github.com/afragen/github-updater
Description:       A plugin to automatically update GitHub hosted plugins and themes into WordPress. Plugin class based upon <a href="https://github.com/codepress/github-plugin-updater">codepress/github-plugin-updater</a>. Theme class based upon <a href="https://github.com/WordPress-Phoenix/whitelabel-framework">Whitelabel Framework</a> modifications.
Version:           1.0.0

GitHub Plugin URI: https://github.com/afragen/github-updater
GitHub Branch:     master
*/
~~~

Optional headers `GitHub Access Token:` and `GitHub Branch:` are available but not required.

The only extra character allowed in a URI is `-`. Let me know if there is a need for others.

## Branch Support

To specify a branch that you would like to use for updating, just add a `GitHub Branch:` header. GitHub Updater will preferentially use a tag over a branch having the same or lesser version number. If the version number of the specified branch is greater then the update will pull from the branch and not from the tag.

The default state is either `GitHub Branch: master` or nothing at all. They are equivalent.

## Filter Hooks

There is a filter hook to set the number of hours for a transient to expire. You can add this to any plugin that you wish to override the default transient expiration. Add an appropriate function returning an integer of the number of hours before expiration of the transient. Default is one hour. Usage as follows.

    add_filter( 'github_updater_set_transient_hours', array( 'GitHub_Updater_GitHub_API', 'transient_hours' ) );
    
### NB - This does not work. Pull requests welcome.
